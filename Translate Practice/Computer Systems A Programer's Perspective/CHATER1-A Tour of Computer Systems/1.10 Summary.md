A computer system consists of hardware and systems software that cooperate to run application programs. Information inside the computer is represented as groups of bits that are interpreted in different ways, depending on the context. Programs are translated by other programs into different forms, beginning as ASCII text and then translated by compilers and linkers into binary executable files.

计算机由硬件和系统软件组成，它们共同协作以运行应用程序。信息在计算机内部的表现是一组又一组的比特，取决于上下文不同，其可以有多种解读方式。程序可以由其它程序翻译成不同的形式，起始是ASCII编码的文本，最终由编译器和链接器转换成二进制可执行文件。

Processors read and interpret binary instructions that are stored in main memory. Since computers spend most of their time copying data between memory, I/O devices, and the CPU registers, the storage devices in a system are arranged in a hierarchy, with the CPU registers at the top, followed by multiple levels of hardware cache memories, DRAM main memory, and disk storage. Storage devices that are higher in the hierarchy are faster and more costly per bit than those lower in the hierarchy. Storage devices that are higher in the hierarchy serve as caches for devices that are lower in the hierarchy. Programmers can optimize the performance of their C programs by understanding and exploiting the memory hierarchy.

处理器读取和解析存储在主存中的指令。自从计算机花费大多数时间在内存、I/O设备和CPU计算机间拷贝数据，系统中的存储设备就被组织成了金字塔结构，在塔顶是CPU寄存器，接着是多级硬件缓存、DRAM主存和硬盘存储器。金字塔中，越靠近塔顶的存储设备访问速度越快，每比特的成本也越高。高层级的设备会作为更低层级的设备的缓存使用。程序员可以通过理解和利用内存层级来优化C程序的性能。

The operating system kernel serves as an intermediary between the application and the hardware. It provides three fundamental abstractions: (1) Files are abstractions for I/O devices. (2) Virtual memory is an abstraction for both main memory and disks. (3) Processes are abstractions for the processor, main memory, and I/O devices.

操作系统内核作为应用程序和硬件的中间人，提供了三种基本抽象：（1）文件作为I/O设备的抽象；（2）虚拟内存同时作为主存和硬盘的抽象；（3）进程作为处理器、主存和I/O设备的抽象。

Finally, networks provide ways for computer systems to communicate with one another. From the viewpoint of particular system, the network is just another I/O devices.

最终，网络为计算机提供了与其它计算机通信的能力。从系统的特殊视角看待网络，其不过只是另一种I/O设备。
